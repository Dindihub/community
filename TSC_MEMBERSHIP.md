## What is the Technical Steering Committee?
TSC is a group of maintainers and Committers that contribute to the creation and maintenance of AsyncAPI initiative. 

## Why the TSC was formed
AsyncAPI joined the Linux Foundation in 2021 to guarantee a system of open governance that promotes ownership and neutrality of all participants in the initiative. 

 
Some of the principles of the Linux foundation partnership include:
* No founding members with special privileges
* Equality among all contributors
* Asynchronous decision making 
* Every committer is a TSC member

## Benefits of becoming a TSC member

Here are the benefits to becoming a  TSC member: 
 
* Recognition from AsyncAPI community
* Exposure for your portfolio to employers and company
* Involved in the voting process on topics concerning entire Initiative

* Included in key decision-making for the Initiative. Especially related to finance. 

## How to become a TSC member
Any maintainer can be a TSC member. In other words, to become a TSC member, you need to become a maintainer in one of the projects in the AsyncAPI Initiative. 

You can do it by doing at least one of below things in AsyncAPI Initiative GitHub organization:
* Initiate a new repository/project and become its maintainer
* Donate existing repository/project and stay as its maintainer
* Support and commit to existing projects and be invited by other maintainers to join them as a maintainer


You can open issues on `bugs`,`docs`,`ideas`,and `reviews`. Pick an issue you would like to work on and follow the steps below to make your first contribution. 

## Make your first contribution
We know you are nervous to make your first contribution. In this section we guide you on steps to becoming a TSC member:

1. Pick an issue
2. Open a pull request
3. Get it merged
4. Get invitation to be a code owner
5. Become a TSC member

**Step 1: Pick an Issue**

Here's how to select an issue to contribute to:
* Join existing PR reviews
* Look for issues with [**good first issue** label](https://github.com/issues?page=1&q=is%3Aopen+org%3Aasyncapi+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
* Join [AsyncAPI Slack community](https://asyncapi.com/slack-invite) and join the `#11_how-to-contribute` channel
* Ask maintainers to do a public live stream called **Let's talk about contributing** where then can explain specific part of the project where you want to contribute

**Step 2: Open a pull request**

To open a pull request successfully, follow our [Git workflows](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/blob/master/git-workflow.md) contributors guide.

Use the following steps to open your pull request:

3. Write an appropriate PR title using [conventional commits specification](https://github.com/asyncapi/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#conventional-commits)

4. Test PR against Github checks-ensure they all pass

**Step 3: Get it merged**

After making a pull request,allow the maintainers/code owners to review your PR.Incase no one is alerted to review your PR,feel free to bring the issue to the maintainers attention by either pinging them on slack or Github. 

Make sure all your PR checks pass(turn to green) to ensure your PR is merged quickly.   

**Step 4: Invitation to become a code owner**

After making several contributions to AsyncAPI, maintainers will recognize you. You will then receive an invitation to join the TSC. Look at [this example from the website repository](https://github.com/asyncapi/website/pull/890).
